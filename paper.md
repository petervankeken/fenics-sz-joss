# Summary

Plate tectonics ... subduction zones ... volcanoes, earthquakes,.... metamorphism .... temperature control [@van_Keken2023-jy]

# Statement of need

`FEniCS-SZ` is cool and is based on @Wilson2023-hr.

`FEniCS-SZ` is intended also for classroom use and augments the FEniCSX Tutorial [@FEniCSX].
